# All lines that do not start with quotation marks are ignored
# The file extension does not matter

# Example for a backup entry:
"Name of Entry (Shown in the program)" "/path/to/folder/or/file/you/want/to/backup/" "/path/to/folder/you/want/to/backup/to/" "delete"

# Each entry is on its own line, and consists of either 3 or 4 strings,
# encapsulated in quotation marks, seperated by 1 space
# The last part ('"delete"') is either there or not, it tells the program
# to delete files that are in the destination folder
# But not in the source folder. (It sets the '--delete' flag in rsync)

# As the '"delete"' is optional, these would both be valid Entries:

"Name of other Entry" "/other/path/to/source" "/other/other/path/to/destination" "delete"
"Name of other Entry" "/other/path/to/source" "/other/other/path/to/destination"
